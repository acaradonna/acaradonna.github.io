# 01_Critique

Inputs
- SITE_URL: https://acaradonna.github.io
- CODE: Jekyll + HTML/CSS/JS
- BRAND MOOD (inferred): precise, confident, quietly inventive; audience: engineers, collaborators, hiring managers
- BOUNDARIES: fast, AA contrast, reduced-motion supported, maintainable code

## Observations
- Composition: Sidebar-frame is strong; content boxes read clearly; hero lacks a distinctive focal gesture.
- Color: Deep navy base is professional; accent blue/green can punctuate sparingly; background should stay static for focus.
- Type: Inter works; hierarchy can benefit from a slightly larger hero and tighter leading in cards.
- Layering: Remove ornamental noise; keep 2–3 layers max for clarity.
- Motion: Favor subtle entrance reveals only; no ambient motion by default.

## Missed Potential
1. Hero lacks a memorable visual accent that still stays calm.
2. Buttons could carry a refined, brand accent gradient—used sparingly.
3. Cards can feel more tactile with a restrained shadow and focus-visible outline.
4. Section headings could carry a minimal underline motif.
5. Systemized tokens ensure consistency (color/motion/space/type).

## Top-5 Opportunities
1) Establish a precise token set (color/space/type/motion).
2) Add a tasteful editorial underline for headings/links.
3) Introduce a single accent gradient only to primary CTAs.
4) Keep reveal motion minimal with reduced-motion equivalents.
5) Prototype one signature accent (e.g., underline that gently expands on hover).
