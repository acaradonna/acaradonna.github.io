# 04_QA — Evaluation & Next Steps

Checks
- Contrast AA: hero text, card body ≥ 4.5:1; large headings ≥ 3:1.
- Reduced motion: underline transitions become instant; no keyframes.
- Performance: no ambient animation; reveals only; no layout jank.
- Browser: latest Chromium/Firefox/Safari; graceful fallbacks on older.

Observations
- Clean baseline keeps attention on content; the Chromatic Thread adds a subtle brand signature without noise.
- CTA gradient reads as an intentional highlight; avoid overuse elsewhere.

Tuning
- Adjust underline thickness per heading level (2px→1px for body links).
- Optionally add Quiet Grid for XL screens only at ≤ 2% opacity.

Next Steps
- Build a tiny theming toggle (Calm/Editorial) that only swaps underline style and CTA gradient presence—no ambient motion.
- If desired, explore a strictly minimal “micro-shift” on card hover (1–2px translate) with reduced-motion guard.
